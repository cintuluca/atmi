\file atmi
\brief Bash script gathering all the project utilities. Usage: 

```
	atmi [-p PATH_TO_CONFIG] [-s PATH_TO_CONFIG] [-a PATH_TO_CONFIG] [-t PATH_TO_CONFIG] [-i PATH_TO_CONFIG] [-f METHOD] [-h]
```

In the following table are described all the different options, together with the specific command to use.

<caption id="multi_row">Command options</caption>
<tr><th>Command			<th>Name		<th>What it does?
<tr><td>atmi -p [PATH_TO_CONFIG]	<td>Plot		<td>Extract and plot the PDF for a given variable at a given hour \n of a given day of the month (see \ref pdfplot.py for more details).
<tr><td>atmi -s [PATH_TO_CONFIG]	<td>Sampling		<td>Sample an atmospheric realization for the given dates (see \n \ref sampling.py for more details).

<tr><td>atmi -t [PATH_TO_CONFIG]	<td>Temperature		<td>Generate the am configuration file for the given atmosphere \n samplings (from file) and run am (see \ref amconfig.py for more \n details).
<tr><td>atmi -i [PATH_TO_CONFIG]	<td>Instrument		<td>Calculate the antenna temperature and do the frequency band \n integration (see \ref Tinstrument.py for more details).
<tr><td>atmi -r [PATH_TO_CONFIG]	<td>Run			<td>Generate the am configuration file for the atmosphere realizations \n in the given data archive and run am (see \ref amtotalrun.py for more \n details).

The file is located in the main directory of the project. It is possbile to move the file in a different path.

\section config_files Configurations
All the different methods (except ```atmi -f``` and ```atmi -h```) need a properly written configuration file in order to work. It is possible to display the configuration format with the command:

```
	atmi -f [METHOD]
```

Here below are listed all the different formats for the configuration file needed by each command, together with the description of each element.
